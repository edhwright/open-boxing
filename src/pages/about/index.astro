			<p>Boxing's many titles are hard to follow. Open Boxing's goal is to make it easier.</p>
			<p>We provide timelines that give you an overview of weight classes, world titles and world champions.</p>
			<p>We publish newspaper articles that have fallen into the public domain to give significant bouts and events context.</p>
			<p>
				Open Boxing is in very early development. One of our goals is to verify every bout and reign with a reference, but until then expect some mistakes. We provide an <a
					href={`${Astro.url.origin}/api`}>API</a
				> to explore our data.
			</p>
