# English Promoters Not Likely to Meet Dempsey's Purse Demand for Fight With Beckett in London

## Manager Jack Kearns Asks $250,000 Guarantee, $10,000 for Expenses and Privilege of 50 Per Cent of Gross Receipts—Tex Rickard Angling for Bout Between Beckett and Tom Gibbons—Timely Ring Gossip

Milwaukee—War time prices will not down, at least not with some of the people interested in sports and amusements. Since the Beckett-Siki match set for December 7th in London has been declared off, English promoters have been endeavoring to secure Champion Jack Dempsey to meet the British champion in London around the 17th of March. Jack Kearns, manager of the champion, was apprised of the fact and immediately cabled back that he would want a guarantee of $250,000, $10,000 for training expenses and a privilege of 50 per cent of the gross receipts.

When James J. Corbett and the ay. late John L. Sullivan met for the world's title about 30 years ago they were glad to get a purse of $25,000 whe and put up $10,000 each for a side bet. Now the gladiators want $10,000 orting bein for training expenses. That is more than most of the big championship battles drew a few decades ago. Why should the promoters take all the chances and stand the brunt of the gaff all through? If the fighters failed to draw enough to pay the guarantees and other expenses the promoters would "get it in the neck" and dig for the losses. Beckett is champion of Great Britain, and as such, would demand a fair purse or percentage, so the promoters would be up against it unless the receipts should be unusually large. It is hardly probable that the English syndicate will come across with any such amount, and it is also doubtful whether Tex Rickard will again put up such a large guarantee. Let the fighters work on a straight percentage basis; that is the only fair way.

Tex Rickard may stage a Joe Beckett-Tommy Gibbons match at the Garden, New York, during December, unless Major Wilson, London promoter, should beat him to the wire and stage a Beckett-Carpentier fight in London. Beckett and Gibbons would prove a big card in New York just now and it would no doubt be a splendid contest. Gibbons would have it on speed and science, but the Englishman can hit and take the gaff, which would kind of even matters up a bit.

On top of all the talk about big matches in New York comes the announcement that the boxing commission has put a ban on gambling and has ordered all known gamblers barred from the various arenas. It is claimed that much of the recent scandal about matches in the big city comes from the gambling end of it. Men will always bet on boxing bouts, baseball and football games and other sports, but the trouble comes when some of the "tinhorns" try to get boxers to lay down in a contest or to try and influence the judges and referees of matches. The man who is always looking for "an ace in the hole" is a poor gambler and a menace to any sport.

When the New York boxing commission recently gave Champion Joe Lynch a lay-off in the big clubs of the metropolis it was done with the intention of compelling the title holder to get into proper shape and was absolutely unfit to engage in a hard title bout when he met Jack Wolfe at the Garden recently. Since then there has been talk of matching Lynch with Pal Moore of Chicago in a title match. If such a bout is contemplated why not take it to New Orleans where the distance could be 20 rounds, with the possibility of a decision being rendered. Ten rounds would be no more than a workout for the two boys.

"Wilmington" Jack Daly, the old-time lightweight, was a caller the other day. About 1900 Jack was some baby with the gloves and boxed the best in the land. He did not hesitate to say that his two hardest battles were with the famous Kid Lavigne, 20 rounds each, losing one and getting a draw in the other. Jack visited London, Paris and Australia with the late Bob Fitzsimmons as sparring partner and is now located at Atlanta, Ga., where he manages several boxers, including Battling Budd and Tim O'Dowd. "There are some good fighters here now," said Jack, "but few of them know the boxing game as we practiced it 30 years ago."

Richie Mitchell, lightweight pride of Milwaukee, tried for a long time to land the championship in that division, but always fell short, although he came awful near to it when he fought Benny Leonard at Madison Square Garden, New York. It was the only time, since Benny has been champion, that he was on the floor taking the count of nine. However, it remained for the junior brother-Pinky-to land a championship. Pinky is now junior welterweight champion of America, having been awarded that honor in a voting contest inaugurated by Mike E. Collins of Minneapolis over six months ago. The National Boxing association sanctioned the contest and the belt, valued at $2,000, will be presented to the winner by the N. B. A., at a meeting to be arranged by Secretary Richard Burke of the championship committee in the near future. There were 20 contestants at the start and over 700,000 votes were cast, Mitchell receiving 100,000 of that number and leading by 40,000. The stipulated weight is 140 pounds, just seven pounds under the senior welter title holder. The winner must defend his crown every six months, if called on by the N. B. A. to do so, or forfeit his claim to it. Harvey Thorpe was Pinky's nearest competitor and it is just possible that he will be selected as opponent for Mitchell in the first title battle.

Tex Rickard of New York has also put up championship belts in junior classes for lightweights and featherweights. The belt habit of recent years was inaugurated by Lord Lonsdale of England, but even there the champions have balked against the terms of gift. Under the present rules the belts donated by Lord Lonsdale can only be fought for at the National Sporting club of London. Other promoters have entered the field there and offer bigger purses with the result that the boxers refuse at times to box in the N. S. C. The public has upheld the boxers in their contention, so that it will be necessary for Lord Lonsdale to change his terms of gift or permit the belts to lie idle in the lockers of the N. S. C. In England it has been customary for the boxers to have a side bet of at least $500, but in America side bets are barred on all sides.
