# Jim Jeffries Won Two Championships Not on Record

## "California Grizzly" Knocked Out La Savate, Champion of France With One Punch After Taking Kick in Jaw—England's Heavyweight Champion "Gives" Him Title After Being Knocked Down Twice—Both Bouts Held in Paris

---

Note--The following story is taken from Tom S. Andrews' book "Ring Battles of Centuries," a complete history and record of the roped arena for over 200 years from 1719 to the present day. The book is published by Tom S. Andrews, of Milwaukee, sport writer and special correspondent of The Boxing Blade. The author of this story, John S. Barnes, is an old time English sportsman who spent many years in the United States in connection with baseball and boxing.

After Jim Jeffries beat Bob Fitzsimmons some fifteen years ago for the heavyweight championship, Jeff was matched again to defend his title against Tom Sharkey. Billy Brady, or, as he is known in theatrical circles, Mr. W. A. Brady, was then Jeff's manager. Mr. Brady, thinking a sea voyage and a couple of months travel would do Jeff good before going into training for his match with the tough Irish sailor, accordingly started for London with his champion and opened a very profitable engagement at the Royal Aquarium, giving sparring exhibitions with different boxers, among whom was one Jack Scales, a young light heavyweight.

At that time, England was very badly off for heavyweights. In fact, people did not know at the time whether England had a champion or not until some small promoter offered a few pounds and a cheap belt to be contested for together with the championship title. This was won by Jack Scales. Then Jack himself said he was champion of England. No one said he wasn't and when he was engaged at four pounds ($20.00) a week to spar with Jeffries and the posters in big red letters said that James J. Jeffries, champion of the world and Jack Scales, champion of England, would each night box for hard, fast rounds, why, that settled it.

After the London engagement closed, Mr. Brady was called to New York and he turned Jeff over to me to handle for the balance of the tour, with the instructions:

"Make what money you can. Give Jeff a good time, and be sure you get him back in the United States in perfect health to start training six weeks before his fight with Sharkey."

### Jeff Fights La Savate Champ.

A week later, I booked Jeff to open in Paris at the Folly Marenoy theater, with Jack Jeffries, his brother, as sparring partner. When our week closed, the manager of the house came to me to know under what conditions would Monsieur Jeffries box Monsieur La Blah, champion la savate boxer of France, Monsieur Jeffries to box la box only, and Monsieur La Blah to box la savate. Or, in other words, the Frenchman was to box the French style; that is, use his hands and feet, and Jim to stick strictly to the Queensbury rules. I had a look at the Frenchman, who only weighed about 140 pounds. I talked with Jeff about the matter and when I explained that it was a handicap, and that the Frenchman had the privilege of punching him in the jaw with his fist, or kicking him in the nose with his feet, Jeff didn't care so much about that. I told Jeff I didn't think the frog was big enough to hurt him with a baseball bat. Besides, the gate receipts were to be raised double and we were to get 55 per cent of the house for our share, regardless of who won.

So the match was arranged for the championship. Jack Jeffries, Jim's brother, and myself were in Jim's corner when the men shook hands for the first time. Jeff assumed his famous crouch, while the Frenchman stood straight up on his toes, with arms folded like a ballet dancer. Jim feinted twice with his left, when the Frenchman did one complete circle of the stage like a Texas Tommy dancer. Jeff dropped his hands and laughed. Jeff made two more feints with his left, when, quick as a flash, the Frenchman leaped clear over Jeff's head, and while doing so kicked Jeff so hard in the jaw with his right foot that the sound was plainly heard all over the house. The Frenchman quickly assumed his ballet dancer position with his arms folded, standing straight up on his toes again.

### One Punch Ends It.

Just then, one of the Frenchman's seconds, in good English, claimed first blood for his man. Jeff was looking over at me, with a kind of a "What-kind-of-a-Jack-Pot-have-you-got-me-up-against" look on his face, when all of a sudden the Frenchman did an acrobatic Turkey Trot, and tried to kick Jeff in the jaw again the same way. Jeff reached up and caught the Frenchman in the jaw with his right and the fight was all over, and Jeff was proclaimed the champion of France.

The theatre manager came to me the following day, saying "Monsieur Jeffries is now be champo of America,—la box ongely. He is also ze la box la savate champion of France. Who is the la box ongely champo?"

Or, in other words, he wanted to know who was the heavyweight champion of England. I said:

"Monsieur Jack Scales, of London."

He asked me if I thought a match could be arranged between him and Monsieur Jeffries for the championship of the world. I told him I thought such a thing was possible. Accordingly, he gave me power to arrange with Monsieur Jack Scales to fight Monsieur Jeffries for the championship of the world, giving 60 per cent of the house and doubling the prices that were charged at the last contest with the Frenchman.

I, at once, took the matter up with Jack Scales at London, telling him if his figures were not too high, I would like to have him box Jeffries in Paris the following week twenty rounds for the championship of the world, asking him to cable me immediately his best terms.

The next day, to my great surprise, I got a wire from him saying "Four pounds and all expenses." I wired him transportation at once and Jack arrived in Paris the following day.

### Reporters Greet Him.

I had the reporters at the St. Lazre station to get snap shots of him when he arrived. I had told the sporting scribes the old gag about his being intended for a clergyman, but that after taking his degrees at college, he changed his mind and went in for boxing and in time won the championship of England. I explained the other old stuff about his never having tasted liquor, never having smoked, never swore, loved his dear old mother, and always was in bed at ten o'clock. As a matter of fact, Jack always trained on sour ale.

The contest was well billed for the championship of the world. Scales was followed by crowds in the streets through Paris. No matter where he went, the same as Jeffries, there was a monster house. Jeff treated Scales not too badly until the third round, when Jeff jabbed him pretty stiff in the nose a couple of times. When Jack came to his corner he said to me:

"'Ere gov'nor. Tell Jim e's not foiting Sharkey, now if Ee goes like that again at me, go blye me, I shall 'ave to chuck it."

The next round Jim got real mean and knocked Jack down twice. When Jack got up the second time, he addressed the audience and said:

"Loidies and gentlemen: E's habsoballylutely too bally big for me and I gives 'im the championship of Hingland."
