## Dundee Treated Unfairly.

JOHNNY DUNDEE is making an awful squawk because Eugene Criqui, featherweight champion of Europe, has been given the preference over him in a match with Johnny Kilbane, holder of the world’s title.

Dundee has a howl coming, too. He has been one of the ring’s best little fighters for the past 15 years, meeting all of the leading boxers in the featherweight and lightweight classes, yet never holding a genuine championship. At present he is in possession of the "junior lightweight championship," a title created by the New York Boxing commission. Willie Jackson handed Dundee his only decisive beating during his long career, knocking out the little Italian with a lucky haymaker in 1917. Dundee squared away this defeat by whipping Jackson on numerous occasions afterward. Johnny has participated in more than 500 battles, his record being one of the most remarkable of any boxer the ring ever produced.

He fought a 20-round draw with Kilbane shortly after the Cleveland Irishman won the title from Abe Attell. Kilbane has sidestepped all offers for a return engagement with the speedy Italian.

Dundee is entitled to another match with Kilbane, but the promoters figure Criqui would be a better box office attraction because of the international aspect of the bout. However, Dundee should get a shot at the winner.
