## DUNDEE CHOICE OVER CRIQUI EVE OF BATTLE

### Frenchman must win by knockout or lose the 15-round decision, say experts. <br> <hr> WILL BE A GREAT CROWD <br> <hr> Another big gate promised for the battle for the featherweight title.

New York, July 25.-No matter which way the fight tomorrow night at the Polo grounds between Eugene Criqui, the featherweight champion of the world, and Johnny Dundee goes, you must hand it to the little Frenchman for his gameness. Gene won the title not more than two months ago and yet he tosses in his championship for the toughest American in his class to shoot at. You don't often hear in modern times of brand new champions taking such chances with their crowns.

Frankly we think Dundee is going to beat the Frenchman. We are inclined to believe that the elastic Italian is altogether too smart for Criqui. We think that Johnny knows much more than Gene does about the game of hit and step aside.

### Expect it to go limit.

The chances are that the fight will go the limit and that Dundee will get the decision. If John is in there at the end of the fifteen rounds he will get the verdict. He surely has had more experience than Kilbane’s conqueror and should be able to win the title on points.

If Criqui wins he should win decisively. He packs a better punch than Dundee and is very likely to put it across at any time. Gene showed against the ancient Kilbane that he carried the sock, but whether he can land it on the careful, lively Dundee is a question.

Dundee has whipped himself down to the required featherweight limit of 126 pounds, notwithstanding the fact he is said to have started training at about 138 pounds. If Dundee weakened himself in the reducing process he is likely to run into a lot of trouble. He can not afford to take chances with the Frenchman. Dundee will need all his strength against the hard-hitting Criqui. If he has not it, there will be another story to tell.

### Look for another big gate.

Both fighters were under the 126 pound limit today. Dundee scaling 124 ½ after a light workout and Criqui a half pound less.

The advance sale reached $100,000 today, according to promoters, who announced they expected it to exceed $150,000 by tomorrow night. Arrangements have been made to handle a crowd of 65,000.
