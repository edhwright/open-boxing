NEW YORK, July 19.-Eugene Criqui is a real champion.

The little featherweight war hero is going to return to Paris August 2, no matter what the outcome of his bout with Johnny Dundee, scheduled for the Polo Grounds July 26. He is going back to appear FOR NOTHING against the best featherweight in France. The funds derived from admissions to the bout will be used to aid disabled war veterans.

It is quite a novel experience for a prizefighter to do anything for nothing. Jess Willard, Luis Firpo, Jack McAuliffe and Floyd Johnson recently staged a benefit for the Milk Fund of New York, and the cash they received would support a million babies for a month.

Jack Dempsey only got $220,000 for boxing 15 rounds with Tommy Gibbons in what his manager, Jack Kearns, called "a good workout for Dempsey". He was to have received $300,000 for the show, and it was only at the last minute that he showed himself "a good sport" and decided to take a chance on his last $100,000.

If Kearns is a "good sport" what kind of a sport would you call Criqui who, in this advanced day of financial frenzy, is going back to fight FOR NOTHING for the disabled soldiers of France?
