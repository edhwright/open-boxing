## Going Down?

<img src="/bouts/1923-07-04-jack-dempsey-v-tommy-gibbons/going-down.jpg" alt="Illustration of Jack Dempsey walking over a hill" width="1500" height="1526" style="height:auto;max-width:100%;" loading="lazy">

Has Dempsey passed the peak?

Is he on the down grade?

There is considerable difference of opinion about Dempsey's showing in Shelby. Many think the champion was always overrated. A few think that he didn't try very hard. And all seem to agree that Jack is not as good as he was a year or so ago.

It doesn't seem probable that Dempsey, who is just 28, should have seen his best days. Yet time is a flighty old thing, and man gets a rough deal as he passes through this vale. He is either going up or down! Man spends long years climbing upward to the top and is rewarded with only a few fleeting moments on the pinnacle where he balances dizzily before he begins to slide downward.

Is Dempsey going down?

Others have gone over the top at a much earlier age than the present champion. Terry McGovern had gone up the hill and down again before he was old enough to vote. Frankle Neil won and lost the bantamweight title before he was 21. Kid Williams was through at the age of 24. Eddie Hanlon passed the peak and was a “has-been” at the age of 19!

Happy, little, cock-eyed Knockout Brown was a sensation 10 years ago. He is almost forgotten now—and he is only 30 years old today.
