## Here's What Fight Means To Gibbons

Here's just about what yesterday's fight at Shelby, Mont., means to Mister Thomas Gibbons:

It means that he's just about as good a fighter as Champion Jack Dempsey.

It means that at 32 he "can take 'em" as well as he could five years ago.

It means that within the next year, he should be a box office attraction throughout the country to the tune of at least $100,000.

It means that he is due for another battle with the champion.

It means that he stands high over all the other heavyweight challengers, who will now have to contend with Gibbons before they get a chance at Dempsey.

It means that if he and Dempsey fight again, he will command nearly as much of a purse as the champion.

It means that he has a powerful lot more friends today than he had yesterday.
