## Promoters Make Elaborate Plans for Staging of Dempsey-Gibbons Bout at Shelby, Montana

### Big arena to be built in natural amphitheater designed to accommodate 100,000 spectators-Rodeo and Wild West Show will be features of big entertainment to be put on in connection with world's championship boxing contest-Over $100,000 cash raised to meet guarantees demanded by principals to bind match

SHELBY, Mont.-Elaborate plans are being outlined for the Jack Dempsey-Tom Gibbons world’s championship boxing contest which the Montana American Legion is confident of staging here next July 4th. Over $100,000 cash had been raised already as this is written to meet the forfeits and guarantees to bind the match demanded by Managers Jack Kearns and Eddie Kane for Dempsey and Gibbons.

The next step will be to sign the champion and the challenger and this is expected to be accomplished by the time this issue of the Boxing Blade is published.

The program in addition to the world championship match will include a rodeo and entertainment designed to portray the early western frontier life that is rapidly disappearing. A huge arena, greater in dimensions than the old Coliseum of Rome, will be built to care for the thousands of spectators that are expected. E. H. Keane is drawing plans for the building and arena, and Ralph V. Ruckner is planning the engineering work.

### Building of Grecian Style

The architecture of the building which will form an entrance to the arena, and the arena itself, will be of Grecian design and patterned after the old Greek amphitheaters. The great bowl of the arena will rise from the ringside in tiers of seats accommodating 100,000 spectators. The plans are so drawn and the topography of the ground is such that additional thousands of spectators may be accommodated. The whole original structure will cover 12½ acres and with extensions to accommodate a greater crowd it will spread over 25 acres. The Coliseum of Rome was elliptical in shape, measuring 512 feet along the major axis, and 167 feet along the minor axis. The seating capacity was 87,000 persons. The Shelby arena will be nearly circular in shape and will measure 864 feet in diameter. The capacity without extensions will be 100,000 spectators. It is estimated that 200 cars of lumber will be needed for the bowl alone. The entrance building will be artistic in design and the architecture will conform to the general scheme. Inclined planes will rise from the entrance way to the different aisles of the arena. Lavatories and rest rooms will be provided at convenient points in the building.

### Ringside Boxes to Seat 725

An innovation in seating arrangement has been introduced into Mr. Keane’s plans providing ringside boxes that will accommodate 725 persons. These boxes will be used for the seating of dignitaries that may be present, and also for press correspondents and operators. There will also be a tower for the motion-picture-camera reporter. The ring itself will measure 24 feet square. Next to the ringside will be 2,500 first class seats and 2,500 second class ringside seats. Back of these will be tiers divided into 86 sectors rising to the bowl’s brim. Landings and aisle space will be arranged to provide for the rapid entrance and exit of the spectators.

The rodeo program will consist of bucking contests, racing and bull-dogging, for which attractive enough prizes to draw the best performers will be awarded. An Indian band may be engaged that will wear full regalia at all times, give native dances, and run some fast strings of horses in the Indian races. The program will be elaborated to an extent that will provide really an exposition of western life and sports. Not many remnants of the typical western frontier life remain, and Shelby wishes to portray for the easterner who comes here western life as it was. In addition to the strictly western entertainment some crack baseball teams may be engaged, aerial stunts, auto polo and other forms of entertainment featured. A complete landscape gardening scheme will be carried out, and everything done to add to the natural beauty of the surroundings.

A radio broadcasting station will be installed at the arena in order to give out the fight round by round. This sending station will be of such power that its messages will be picked up all over the United States and Canada.
