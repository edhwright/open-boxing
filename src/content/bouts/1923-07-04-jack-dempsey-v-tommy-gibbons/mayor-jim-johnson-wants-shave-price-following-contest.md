## MAYOR JIM JOHNSON WANTS SHAVE PRICE FOLLOWING CONTEST

### Executive Out $150,000 on Promotion but May Recoup From Rights in Movies.

Shelby, July 4.-(By The Associated Press.j)-Major Jim Johnson, the 60-year-old executive of this boom town, who is reported to have personally lost $150,000 in convincing the world that Shelby would keep its word in staging the Dempsey-Gibbons fight, smiled a weak smile when seen standing in a doorway on the busy Main street Wednesday night.

"Well," he said; "we saw a fight, didnt we?"

"Slip me the price of a shave."

Maybe Mayor Johnson, who holds a fat interest in the moving picture rights, may recoup some of his losses from this source. The pictures probably will prove to be valuable as Gibbons is the only fighter who has ever stayed the limit with Dempsey since the Utah mauler became champion.

Neither Kearns nor Dempsey have a dimeâ€™s interest in the moving picture rights. They relinquished their share to the promoters when the difficulty arose of digging up the final $100,000 installment due Dempsey. Gibbons has a 25 per cent interest
