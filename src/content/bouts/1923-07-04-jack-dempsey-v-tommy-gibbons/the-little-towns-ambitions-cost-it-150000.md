## THE LITTLE TOWN'S AMBITIONS COST IT $150,000

### SHELBY NOW DIGGING BACK INTO OBLIVION <br> <hr> Rush to Get Away Began When Fight Was Over---Total Receipts Announced As $225,000---Gibbons Gets Nothing.

Shelby, Mont. July 5.—(United Press.)—Shelby's folly!

It's a long story and the last chapter is still in doubt, but this is the gist of the plot:

A little cow town of the Montana plains got ambitious. It stopped talking cows, dance halls and girls and started yelling for a bout for the heavyweight championship of the world in figures with six ciphers.

Jack Dempsey was obtained for $300,000 and Tommy Gibbons for a percentage of the gate receipts. Today Jack Dempsey has about $250,000 and Gibbons has nothing but the honors and a chance at some of the picture money, and everyone in Shelby who was interested in the affair is counting his losses. Just exactly what was lost probably will never be known, because Shelby is proud, but the experts figure it at something more than $150,000.

Rising up out of the mud to stand in headlines on the first pages of newspapers throughout the country for a few weeks, Shelby now is digging itself back into oblivion.

There is just one place where Shelby will be remembered a year from now and that is in the sporting records which will recall the brilliant performance of Tommy Gibbons in a fight for the championship.

Otherwise, it will be just the same little cow town-with nearly everybody broke-marked with an "F" on the Great Northern timetables to signify trains will stop if flagaed.

The thousands who came here are evacuating today. The streets already are thinning out. The girl shows are folding their tents and stealing away. Even they lost money.

All night long, quiet, tired crowds trudged the streets making a more or less Fourth of July celebration, while a gang of armed revenue agents stood guard over the debris-the last two days’ receipts in the safe deposit vaults of a local bank. Jack Kearns, manager of Dempsey, who took a loss that may amount to $50,000, would not let the cash get out of his possession. He will take his share out today.

"We got about $75,000 out of it these last two days,” Kearns said. (Skeptics doubt this.) I reduced the price of $20 tickets to $10 at the last hour rather than have the tickets go to waste entirely.

"The government made me pay taxes on the face value or $2 on every $10 sale, but every sale was like picking up $8. The last big crowd to come in crashed the gates and didn’t pay anything.

"Someone cut the wires around the outside of the arena. The sheriffs fired five shots but they kept coming and we could not stop them.

"Dempsey hadn't fought for two years and this was a good workout for him.

"Gibbons was just in there to stay the limit and he was a hard, slippery man to fight.

"Jack is going to Salt Lake City from Great Falls and I am going to New York to arrange a fight with Harry Wills."

Kearns said he had to pay the referee, the preliminary boys, the workers around the arena and part of the police costs when the Great Falls bankers failed at the last minute to keep a promise to furnish $8,000 for these purposes.

The promoters’ statement sald the official attendance by the government’s check was only 7,202 and the receipts $223,000, of which the government took a total of $22,500.

But whoever is right, Shelby was wrong.

And now all the inhabitants want to have the crowds go back where they came from and let Shelby sleep the peace of the just in the full-baked mud out here, a million miles from Broadway.
