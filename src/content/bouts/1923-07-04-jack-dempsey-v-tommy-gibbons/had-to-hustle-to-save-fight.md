## HAD TO HUSTLE TO SAVE FIGHT

GREAT FALLS, Mont., June 17-The Jack Dempsey-Tom Gibbons heavyweight championship fight, sagging at the knees and ready to collapse, was shoved back on its feet last night with new executives in charge, and Jack Kearns, manager of the champion, happy with the receipt of a $100,000 draft, the second instalment due on the $300,000 guarantee.

The fight will be staged as scheduled in Shelby on the fourth of July afternoon.

Payment of the $100,000 was made by George H. Stanton, president of the Stanton Trust and Savings Bank, early last night. The story of the raising of the $100,000 is one of the rarest tales of financing in the history of boxing. Mayor Jim Johnson of Shelby, 60 years of age, was individually responsible for raising $76,000 in less than 24 hours, while Great Falls business men raised the balance.
