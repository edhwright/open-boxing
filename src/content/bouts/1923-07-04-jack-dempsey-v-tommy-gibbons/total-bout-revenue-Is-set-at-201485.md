## Total Bout Revenue is Set at $201,485

### 7,966 Pass Gate, Says Rasmussen; Kearns Short $48,000 on Third $100,000; Loss to Promoters and Business Men $80,000.

Shelby, July 4.-(By The Associated Press.)-The approximate total of gate receipts at the Dempsey-Gibbons heavyweight title bout Wednesday afternoon was $201,485, according to figures made public Wednesday night by Charles Rasmusson, Montana collector of internal revenue.

The department of internal revenue will collect a total of $22,448.50 on the receipts, Rasmusson announced.

### Many at Half Price

Approximately 2,300 tickets in the $20 seat section were sold at half price, he said, and on these tickets the government tax of 10 per cent was collected, even though the promoters suffered a loss of $10 on each ticket thus sold.

The total number of tickets taken in at the gate was 7,202, Rasmusson's figures showed. A total of 764 passes were given out, bringing the recorded attendance on the face of the collector’s figures to 7,966.

Jack Kearns, Dempsey’s manager, fell approximately $48,000 short of getting the third $100,000 of the champion’s guarantee.

He received approximately $52,000 in receipts Tuesday and Wednesday, it was announced. He paid the federal tax on $75,000 worth of tickets, however, owing to the fact that he assumed a tax at the rate of 10 per cent on tickets which he sold at half price, just before the crowd surged through the gates and into the arena.

### Rest "Gate Crashers"

The discrepancy betWeen the number of paid admissions and the number that actually witnessed the fight was due to the faet that thousands of persons "crashed" the gate. In other words, they overwhelmed the gate keepers and police and swarmed into the arena.

The total loss on the fight to the promoters and business men of Shelby, Great Falls and other Montana towns will be approximately $80,000, the figures made public Wednesday night revealed.
