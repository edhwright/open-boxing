## RICKARD TO MATCH CHAMP WITH FIRPO WILLARD GO VICTOR

### Veteran Promoter Expects to Sign Bout Next Week; Praises Gibbons.

New York, July 4.-(By The Associated Press.)—Tex Rickard announced Wednesday that he will start negotiations at once to match Jack Dempsey with the winner of the Luis Firpo-Jess Willard bout for the world’s title fight; probably at Boyle’s Thirty Acres, Jersey City, in September or October.

Willard and Firpo, who will battle at the Jersey City arena July 12, have signed an agreement under the terms of which the winner will be matched with Dempsey, Rickard said. The promoter has made no definite offer to the champion but expects to sign articles when Dempsey comes east next week with his manager, Jack Kearns, to witness the Firpo-Willard go.

The promoter was warm in his praise of Tom Gibbons' showing against Dempsey in Wednesday's fight.

"I have said all along that Gibbons is the best man of his weight in the country, and his fight today proves it," Rickard declared. "He was under a heavy handicap in weight, but battled gamely and cleverly. I don't think Dempsey has gone back. He simply had a hard man to beat."
