## Tommy Was Fouled Says Timekeeper

### Gibbons Bears Marks That Show He Was Hit Low

Glacier Park, Mont., July 6—Richard T. Burke, of New Orleans, who acted as official time keeper for the Dempsey-Gibbons fight today made the statement that as the result of Dempsey's low body blows Tom Gibbons bears on his groins black and blue marks as large as a man's hand.

Burke said, however, he did not believe that Dempsey intentionally fouled Gibbons.

The only words spoken by the combatants during the fight were uttered by Gibbons, Timekeeper Burke said. It was in one of the early rounds and Gibbons, while exchanging blows with Dempsey, addressed himself to his opponent, saying, "For God's sake, Jack, get 'em up." He was referring to three or four body blows struck him in the groins, Burke explained.

"I saw Gibbons this morning before I left Shelby for Glacier Park," Burke went on, "and Tommy showed me the black and blue marks on his groins. I immediately said: ‘Why, Tom, the press ought to know about this, whereupon, Gibbons beseeched me not to tell the newspaper men. ‘I don't have to have any alibi in this fight,’ Gibbons said."

Tip O'Neil, well-known Great Falls oil magnate, told the same story in the lobby of the Glacier Park hotel, last night, declaring he saw the marks on Tommy's body.
