## CHAMPIONSHIP BOUT TO BE STAGED TOMORROW

### AGREEMENT REACHED AT LAST MINUTE <br> <hr> Kearns to Take Sportsman's Chance in Hope Dempsey Will Get His Contract Money Out of Receipts. <br> <hr> WHOLE NIGHT IN PARLEYS

GREAT FALLS, Mont., July 3.—Taking a gambler's and a sportman’s chance, Jack Kearns, in the "wee hours", of this morning, agreed to send Jack Dempsey into the ring against Tommy Gibbons in Shelby on July 4.

Kearns is taking a "studgame" chance that he will be able to obtain the remainder of the $300,000 purse guaranteed him in his contract.

### Kearns Made Many Offers.

After a whole night spent in conferences, during which Kearns made overture after overture to help the promoters out of their difficulties, it was finally agreed that Kearns should accept the $200,000 that has already been paid him on behalf of the champion and gamble on the gate receipts to make additional $100,000.

Throughout the conference, Kearns offered every proposition that he knew of to make the fight good. He suggested a postponement a month, he offered to fight for $250,000 and he expressed his willingness to go on with the $200,000 that had already been paid to him and to take his chances of getting the rest of his $300,000 purse from the gate after the expenses of the show, including the purses for the preliminaries, the salaries of the ushers and the special police had been paid.

### Wants to be Good Sport.

After the agreement had been affected, Kearns said he was actuated throughout by the desire to be a "good fellow" and "sportsman" he declared he felt he had done his part in as much as he had not declared the contract invalidated at midnight when the final payment of his purse was not forthecoming and when it was within his legal right to declare the fight off.

During the early morning conference, George Stanton, Great Falls banker and all the committee of financiers interested in the fight admitted they have not one single cent with which to guarantee the final payment of the Dempsey purse.

It was then that Kearns made terms by which a settlement was affected.

During the excitement the champion was spending his time at the training camp playing hearts with his sparring partners and a few friends who had jumped away from the financial frenzy of the town to keep him company.

### Signed in Good Faith.

Kearns said he had signed the contract in good faith and had turned down several offers for the champion on the national holiday, but that he had signed a contract with persons he thought responsible and that he was willing and ready to go through with it.

Kearns also declared he had been unable to learn who was in charge of the Shelby ticket office and that he was leaving this morning to watch the sale of tickets.

The manager of the champion said also that he had reached an agreement with Eddie Kane, manager of the challenger, and that they had agreed there would be a fight for the world’s heavyweight championship in Shelby July 4, between Jack Dempsey and Tommy Gibbons.

Kearns left for Shelby on an early train. He intended to look over final arrangements there, and see how the last minute ticket-sales were coming on.

### Promoters Face Certain Loss.

As matters now stand, the promoters would appear to be facing a certain loss of thousands of dollars in putting on the fight. The sale of tickets has been stopped and started so many times that no one appears to have a very definite idea of how many have been sold.

Consequently, in view of the complete financial chaos prevailing the conferences las night began to develop a willingness on the part of the promoters to let the match go by default.

For the past week Kearns has been the object of criticism for insisting upon payment of the final $100,000 before permitting Dempsey to go in the ring. But when the final conferences were reached, Kearns appears to have been the aggressor in seeking a way out of the financial tangle, and putting on the fight. The promoters, appearing to be getting to the point where they figured calling the fight off would be the cheapest way out for them.

### Anxious To Get It Over.

Shelby's greatest desire now is to go ahead and get the fight over. Despite the optimism caused by the dispatches from Great Falls the excitement was not as great as it might have been, because heretofore every time the fight was declared on it was shortly afterwards called of.

Tommy Gibbons had to beawakened to hear the news.
