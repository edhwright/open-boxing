## Financial Difficulties Serious for Big Fight

### RUMORS ASSERT BATTLE TO FAIL WHEN PAYMENT DUE ON MONDAY

GREAT FALLS, Mont., June 28—The confusion into which the financing of the Jack Dempsey-Tommy Gibbons fight, scheduled for Shelby, July 4, was thrown yesterday as a result of the resignation of Dan Tracy as business manager, grew in volume all day today until it became apparent tonight that the promoters have no definite plan for raising the final $100,000 due Dempsey on his $300,000 guarantee.

From none of the men associated with the promotion of the battle could it be learned tonight that the $100,000 installment for Dempsey was definitely in sight or that plans are under way that bring from the promoters anything more than “expressions of hope” that the money can be raised.

### Johnson in Charge

The day was filled with rumors, contradictions, denials and evasions originating with various men identified with the promotion. All through it, Mayor Jim Johnson of Shelby, treasurer of the fight, who has personally sunk a fortune of $150,000 in the venture, continued to make announcement that the fight would be held as scheduled and that Jack Kearns manager of the heavyweight champion, would receive the $100,000 when due next Monday, if not before. Mayor Johnson, however, gave no indication of where he expected to raise the money or how, aside from saying that he was working on two or three different plans.

Early in the day, J. W. Speer, a state senator and attorney for Johnson, announced that $50,000 had been assured by one individual to help make up the $100,000 installment. Attorney Speer declined to make public the name of this individual, but it was understood that Johnny O'Neill, a wealthy oil operator and a member of the American Rugby team that competed in the Olympic games of 1920, had agreed to furnish $50,000 of the amount to be raised. O'Neill tonight emphatically denied this but declared he was working on a plan to raise the money that gave him reason to hope that he would be suceessful. He declined to say with whom he was negotiating further than to admit that he was trying to deal with parties located in the Middle West.

### Kearns Holds Talks

Kearns returned from Shelby along with Mayor Johnson today and remained at his hotel conferring with bankers and influential Great Falls citizens who want the fight held. He gave no intimation that he would agree to any compromise of his contract, which provides that Dempsey shall receive $300,000 as his guarantee for meeting Gibbons in addition to $10,000 for training expenses. Kearns already has received $210,000.

“I am in no position to make any statement,” Kearns said. “I don’t believe it is up to me to say anything until the Shelby promoters fail to go through with thelr contract, which provides that Dempsey shall get his last $100,000 next Monday. I have been assured by Mayor Johnson of Shelby that the money will be paid and my hands are tied until he fails to make good.”

Johnson said, following the retirement of Tracy, that he was in position to personally guarantee that the $100,000 due Dempsey would be paid when due and itemized a list of property which he said he would pledge if necessary to make the payment. This property, he declared, has a value of $300,000 and is unincumbered.

### Would Finance Alone

This statement was repeated several times today by Johnson, with the assertion that he would draw upon his personal resources to put the fight over if it became necessary,

E. F. Cobb of Geyser, Mont., a real estate dealer, offered Kearns a deed to a ranch in the Snow mountains, valued at $150,000, as a substitute for the $100,000 installment. The ranch is one of the show places of Montana and formerly was owned by R. A. Harlow, former railroad builder and now a resident of Washington, D. C. Kearns said he could not discuss any alteration in his contract with anybody except the promoters.

Cobb said that if Kearns accepted the ranch he was satisfied that he could make a satisfactory adjustment with the promoters after the gate receipts are in.

The opinion prevails in Great Falls tonight that unless the $100,000 installment is paid Kerns before next Monday, the fight will result in heavy financial failure, which seems already probable, and that to delay paying the installment until Monday would so seriously interfere with the plans of many fans that it would be too late for them to come from distant points.
