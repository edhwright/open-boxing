## 200,000 Enthusiastic Fight Fans Trying to Buy Tickets For Dempsey-Firpo Clash in New York

### POLO GROUNDS HAS ROOM FOR ONLY 80,000 <br> <hr> Fans Fighting for Ducats Even Though It Looks Like One-Sided Scrap

New York, Aug. 24.-Regardless of whether the fight is to be a fight or a farce, opinion differing on this point, the Dempsey-Firpo enterprise seems destined to be a sell out, even at this premature moment.

"I could sell 200,000 tickets if I had that number of seats," Tex Rickard, the promoter, declared today.

### Can't keep 'Em Away

Just why this should be so, Mr. Rickard neglects to explain. He will tell you it is the reward of downright merit; that the bout is of such appeal he couldn't keep them out with a shot gun. Yet Mr. Rickard could go out on Broadway and get as much as six to one against Mr. Firpo's chances of beating Dempsey.

Such odds are not flattering to Firpo as a challenger nor to Rickard as a promoter. They would seem to indicate that the latter had stubbed a mental toe by tieing himself up with a match so unequal that the public would stay away in droves. The facts are otherwise.

A man of undoubted influence with Rickard some days ago aired the idea of placing an order for $650 worth of tickets in the first 10 rows. He was informed that, by the morest whimsy of the fates he could have two tickets in the tenth row. The next would be back in the thirty-first.

### Eighty Thousand is Capacity

Lincoln was quite right. You may not be able to fool all of the people all of the time, merely about 80,000 of them. We mention this figure because it represents the estimated capacity of the Polo Grounds on the night of the Dempsey-Firpo bout. Once a customer, always a customer.

The customer figures and not with out justification, that a man of Firpo's size and hitting ability always has a chance. He, the customer, wants to be there to see him, the challenger, make the most of it. Failing in this, the customer will then be able to indulge in the ghoulish pleasure incidental to watching a tremendous, hairy, berserk super man knocked for a latin semicolon. Anyway it would be too good to miss.
