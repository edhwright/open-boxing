## 21 Months Ago Firpo Left To Whip Dempsey

New York, Sept. 14.-Twenty-one months ago Friday a husky young Argentine of solemn mien walked into the United States consulate and asked Vice Consul Walters to vise a passport bearing the name Luis Angel Firpo. The holder's occupation was given as "boxeador."

"What's the object of your visit to the United States?" asked Walters.

"I'm going up to get a fight with Jack Dempsey," was the answer.

"You think you can lick him?" queried the vice consul with a smile.

"That's what I'm going for," replied Firpo quietly.

"You don't tell me!" exclaimed Walters, as he entered in his record book the object of Firpo’s visit as "training for boxing."

On the margin he penciled: "Says he’s going to lick Dempsey-vamos a ver. (We'll see)."

When Firpo sailed a few days later on his first trip to New York his departure was noted with only brief items in the Argentine newspapers. Today he is a national hero.
