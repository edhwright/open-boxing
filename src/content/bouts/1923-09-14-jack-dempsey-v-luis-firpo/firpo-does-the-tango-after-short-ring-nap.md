## Firpo Does the Tango After Short Ring Nap

New York, Sept. 15.-Luis Angel Firpo slept late today.

Following his first nap of last evening in the ring at the Polo Grounds, the defeated South American went to Peronaâ€™s restaurant, danced the tango and joined a host of his countrymen in what had been planned as a celebration of victory.

He showed no marks of the battle. Firpo was in good spirits and danced until about 2 a. m.
