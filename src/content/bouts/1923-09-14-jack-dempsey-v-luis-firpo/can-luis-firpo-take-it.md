## Can Luis Firpo Take It?

### _That's What Dempsey Wants to Know_. <br> <hr> Jack Sure Foe Can Sock

White Sulphur Springs, N. Y., Aug. 24.-A kindly disposed individual drifted into Jack Dempsey's training camp today to give the champion some first hand information.

"Say, this Firpo baby ain't no soft thing, let me tell you that," he said.

"And that bird can sock, too," added the informant.

"That is another bit of information which I have acquired prior to your coming," gently commented the champion.

"He's rough and tough and he's a whole lot faster than most folks think he is," said the stranger.

The champion, lifting his moving picture eye brows, forgot all about his polished grammar, and burst forth thus:

"But can he take it-can he take it? You ain't said anything about that. And that's the most important thing there is in the cute little game where men try to bust each other into twilight sleep. I never care about how hard guys can hit, how fast they are and stuff like that. That's not the test of a great fighter.

"Can he take it, that's what interests me and that's the only thing that interests me. Jess Willard could sock but he couldn't take it. That's why I whipped him. Bill Brennan could sock but he couldn't take it and I whipped him. Carpentier had a pretty good socker. But he couldn't take it, and don't let anybody tell you that Fred Fulton couldn't sock. But he couldn't take it.

"I'm not making any predictions about this Firpo fight. Not just now. But let me tell you this. If Luis can't take 'em, and take 'em a lot, Luis will never take any world's championship back to Argentine, no matter how hard he can sock."
