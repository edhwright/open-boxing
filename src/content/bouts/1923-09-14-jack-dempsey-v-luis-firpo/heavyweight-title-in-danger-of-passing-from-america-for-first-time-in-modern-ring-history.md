## Heavyweight Title in Danger of Passing From America for First Time in Modern Ring History

For the first time in a generation the Isle of Manhattan to-night will be the scene of a heavyweight championship battle, one in which the world's title will be at stake, when Jack Dempsey squares off against Luis Angel Firpo in the ring at the Polo Grounds. And, for the first time in the history of modern Queensbury championships, the heavyweight crown is in jeopardy of resting on the brow of other than an American-that is, a North American.

Dempsey and Firpo are fit and ready for the call of the referee to the centre of the arena. The name of the third man will not be announced until the men are ready to step in the ring. This afternoon, at 2 o'clock, Dempsey and Firpo will meet for the first time, when they appear at the office of the Boxing Commission for the official weighing in.

It was announced last night by Promoter Tex Rickard that the Dempsey-Firpo tussle would begin as close to 9:30 o’clock as it is possible for him to get the big boys into the ring, and that the semi-final would take place immediately after Dempsey and Firpo "do their stuff." Gene Tunney, the American light heavyweight champion, and Leo Gates are scheduled for the twelve-round semi-final.

The weather man promises a clear and cool evening for the big fight. In the event of rain, the championship will be held tomorrow night, or the first clear night following.

The receipts promise to exceed one million and a quarter dollars, and the paid attendance may surpass the record of 74,716, established when Firpo fought Jess Willard at Boyle’s Thirty Acres two months ago.
