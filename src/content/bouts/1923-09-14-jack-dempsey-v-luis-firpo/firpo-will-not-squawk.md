## FIRPO WILL NOT SQUAWK

### Knows He Was Fouled, But Only Wants Another Chance. <br> <hr> A REAL SPORTSMAN

NEW YORK, Sept. 20.—The decision of the referee is sufficient for Luis Angel Firpo, and despite the protests of his friends and many spectators of his fight with Jack Dempsey that he was unfairly treated and fouled, he asks nothing more than another match with the world’s champion.

The true sportsmanship of the Argentine fighter is shown in a statement given by him to the Associated Press, in which he first defends his chief second Horatio Lavelle, indirectly accused of incompetency by William Muldoon, chairman of the state boxing commission, and ends by simply asking another battle with his conqueror when he has rested and his arm has healed.

### LOST ON FOULS.

Dempsey was declared by thousands of spectators not only to have struck Firpo viciously after the call of time, and to have disregarded the referee's instructions as to retreating to a neutral corner during a knockout count, but technically to have lost the fight on a foul when he was assisted back to the ring by reporters, after having been knocked through the ropes by Firpo in the first round.

Referee Gallagher is also declared to have neglected starting a count until Dempsey had been returned to the ring.

Chairman Muldoon said after the fight that had Firpo’s seconds claimed a foul when Dempsey was pushed back into the ring, the state boxing commission would have recognized the claim and declared Firpo the winner. No such claim was made.

Firpo has been urged by his South American admirers and many others to protest against the decision of Referee Gallagher. His statement follows:

### ONE FOR MULDOON.

"There has been enough discussion of the fouls in my match with Jack Dempsey. The charges against Horatio Lavelle are unjust because Mr. Muldoon, chairman of the New York Boxing Commission, assured us that justice would be done for me.

"I have read what Mr. Muldoon has said on the subject of fouls, and I appreciate it. I have also read many references by sporting writers to the same matter. But notwithstanding this, I want to make one thing perfectly clear:

"I accept the decision and all I want is another match with Dempsey as soon as my arm is all right and I have had sufficient rest."
