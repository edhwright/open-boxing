## WHAT FIGHTERS AND REFEREE HAVE TO SAY

Jack Dempsey, the champion, declared to-day that he "never had such a fight" in all his life. The defeated challenger, Luis Firpo, said he "wants another crack at Dempsey-in about a year, or so." Here are their statements:

### BY JACK DEMPSEY

Firpo can fight. He's a dangerous man in the ring. What a right he has! When he knocked me through the ropes I knew something struck me, but wasn't sure just what. It was the first time I had been knocked down since I became champion. But I gave Firpo all I had. I did a little knocking down myself. I knew I was in a fight-but so did Firpo.

### BY LUIS FIRPO

Dempsey Is a great fighter. He hit me plenty. I had my chance, too-when I put him through the ropes. It was anybody's fight for a while. I am disappointed at not winning, but I think I put up a creditable fight, and I want another chance at Dempseyâ€”inside of a year.

### BY REFEREE J. GALLAGHER

It was a thriller while it lasted. Dempsey showed that he is a real champion by taking the blows he did, and then came back and put the big fellow away as neatly as he did. That boy Firpo can sock, and he can take it, too.
