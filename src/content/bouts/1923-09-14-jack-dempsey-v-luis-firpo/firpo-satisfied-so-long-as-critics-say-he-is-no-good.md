## FIRPO SATISFIED SO LONG AS CRITICS SAY HE IS NO GOOD

### _Declares That When Experts Begin to Admit That He Is Good He Will Get Worried--Cries of Hostile Fans Not to Affect His Fight._

Atlantic City, N. J., Sept. 4.—(Special.)—I know that when I get into the ring to fight Jack Dempsey for the championship of the world I will be surrounded by a crowd shouting for my defeat. As I go through the crowd from my dressing room to the ring men will stand on their chairs and shout evil things at me. They will wave their fists their chairs and shout their heads off and call me bad names and tell me that Dempsey will do terrible things to me. I will not know what the words are, but one does not need to know a language to know the meaning when a man scowls and shouts and shakes his fist.

I will smile and wonder to myself if these brave men who wish me ill in so loud a voice would like to come up in the ring with me and call me names? I will wonder if perhaps six or even twelve of them at once would like to come into the ring with me and call me bad names.

I do not think they would do so even if they had the chance. Men who speak insults from the crowd are like those who write bad letters and sign no names. They are cowards, and it is easy to laugh at the things which cowards say, no matter how bad they may be. Some have asked me whether it would discourage me to have the crowd against me. That is a little bit funny, too. It would discourage me, perhaps, if the crowd in a strange country was not against me, because then I would think that I was so little to be feared that I could not make enemies. Some great writer (I cannot remember his name) once said that when the critics in the newspapers no longer took the trouble to say that he was no good, then he would think that he was no longer a great author.

### NOT WORRIED.

It is so with me. So long as the boxing critics think it is worth while to print columns about me, saying that I am no good. I am not worried. So long as the cowards and the mean ones in the crowds that come to watch me fight think me enough to be feared to take the trouble to stand on chairs to boo and hiss and scream insults at me, that long I will know that I am dangerous and have a good chance to win.

To prove this I have only to say that it was only after the mean ones in the North American crowds began to think me dangerous that they began to boo and hiss me. The first time this happened was at Jersey City, when I fought Willard. Then, for the first time, I think, some began to think that perhaps after all I might beat Willard and then defeat Dempsey and become champion of the world, and so then, for the first time, the mean ones booed and hissed and screamed insults at me. I would not have the people who read what I say think I mean that most of the people in the North American crowds are not fair. It is only of the few I speak, the few cowards that can be found in all great crowds who scream and hiss, the few like those who shouted insult at poor Criqui, the Frenchman, when he was fighting at his best and having his championship taken from him.

To those who think that I might be discouraged because the crowd is against me, I would say do not bet against me on that account. I do not speak English so the shouts of a hostile crowd here are not so liable to bother me as the cries of an inimical crowd of Spanish people. Many, many times I have fought before Spanish speaking crowds which were almost all against me and when I could understand all that was said. You may know that there is the most great rivalary between Argentine and Chile-one time I fought in Chile before a crowd of 12,000 people and at least 11,500 of them were screaming insults at me from the beginning. I did not pay attention except to feel good that I was a sufficiently dangerous fighter to make all those fear me so much that they screamed bad names at me. It will not be a new thing for me to fight before a crowd which does not wish that I win.

### AN AMERICAN.

Perhaps the feeling against me here is more keen than it would be against a European, because I am more nearly their neighbor. Sometimes I think it is forgotten that I am as much an American as you who read this. You are North American. I am South American. For many years now most of the world’s champions have been held by citizens of North America. It is a thought of great pride to me that I am the first fighter from South America to fight for the world's championship in any class.

If I am so fortunate that I win, I will be proud that the greatest prize to be won by a prize fighter does not leave American hands but goes only from North America to South America. I have had read to me accounts in some newspapers saying that I was having trouble with my left arm.

Some have said that I had neuritis and others that I was bothered with the ‘matism. The truth is that I slightly strained the muscles in my left arm in practicing a new method of using it. It was just a little sore for two days, but is all right again. I have never at any time felt better before a fight. I am in the best of physical condition and I am satisfied that my progress with training is all that I could wish.
