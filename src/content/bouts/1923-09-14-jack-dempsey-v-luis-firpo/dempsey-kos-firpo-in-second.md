## DEMPSEY K.O.'S FIRPO IN SECOND

### Ten Knockdowns Feature Savage Fight for Heavyweight Crown

Jack Dempsey is still the champion boxer of the universe, but oh, boy! what a tough time he had in retaining his title against the plunging, rip-tearing Bull of the Pampas, Luis Angel Firpo, at the Polo Grounds last night!

Dempsey turned the trick in the second round with a series of left and right hand smashes to Luis's jaw.

The first crack in the second round that Jack landed was a left hook to the head, with a right to chin, and Luis went down, but came up in a moment. The champ followed him, ripping left hooks to the head.

Firpo was practically out then, but Jack kept at the job. Down went Firpo in a heap. Firpo was lying on his back unable to respond when the referee had swung the fatal count of ten. It was an awful fight from the first bell. Nothing like it was ever staged in a heavyweight contest.

### Start with Rush.

There was no fiddling around. Dempsey tore in right off the reel, hooking lefts to head and righthand smashes to the heart. Suddenly Dempsey rushed in with a left to the stomach and as Luis bent over he chopped a right to the head and Luis went down for the first time. Three more times did Jack smash him to the floor, and as Firpo regained his feet after the fourth knockdown Dempsey stepped in to finish him, throwing caution to the winds.

The South American sneaked through one of his famous rights to Dempsey’s chin, driving him through the ropes into the arms of the scribes at the ringside. The champ worked his way back into the ring, but was in bad shape as he squared off against the maddened scrapper from Argentina.

### Both Combatants Groggy.

Firpo tore in, using his arms like flails. Down went Dempsey. But he did not stay there long. Up came the champ and banged Luis to the floor with another shower of lefts and rights to the head. Firpo came up fighting furiously and held his own in a fast exchange. It looked like any man’s fight at that point. Both men were groggy, but Dempsey the stronger. He knocked Firpo down for the sixth time in that round, and as the referee started to count over Firpo Dempsey reeled away to rest against the ropes.

Luis regained his feet and they both whaled away for dear life at the bell. It was apparent that the fight would be short, and, while Firpo had been up and down like an elevator in this inning, he was still strong.

The seconds worked over them desperately in their corners. There hadn’t been any feeling about what the other had. The big fighters put everything they had on each sock.

Luis’s seconds were much excited as they rubbed him during the rest, but Firpo showed no fear when the bell sent them into action for the second round.

### Dempsey Didn't Box.

In the second Dempsey tore into Firpo with the determination to win or blow his title to the stranger from the South. He didn’t try to box his big opponent. On the contrary, he was as careless as Firpo ever was as he tore in, trying with lefts for the stomach.

Several times Jack missed with his left and Luis nailed him with rights to the mouth, and right there it was any man’s fight. Suddenly Jack got the range with a left hook and a right clout to the face and Firpo went to the floor, where he took a short count. Then came the old crusher.

Dempsey stood over Firpo until he regained his feet and then he was after his prey with renewed fury. His seconds, especially Jack Kearns, were after him to hold his guard high, but he didn’t hear them. He had been stung in the first round and had not regained his composure. He just wanted to get at Firpo and he did.

### Firpo Couldn’t Get Up.

A well directed shot to the chin with his ponderous right hand, following a left hook to the stomach, did the trick and down went Firpo as if he had been shot.

He lay motionless on the floor until the referee went through the count. At five Firpo’s body twitched and he tried to roll over, but he was helpless. When the fatal ten was tolled the big South American was still down there unable to get up.

When the ten had been sounded and Dempsey was still the champion, Firpo’s seconds together with Dempsey picked up the prostrate Luis and helped him to his corner.

Poor Luis had blown his last chance, but he gave the champ lots to think of. The time of the second round was 57 serends and ended one of the fastest fights since heavyweight histery. Lack of experience cost Luis his chance.

He showed all his wonderful hitting ability and proved beyond any question that he could take a sock and come back.

He didn’t fear Dempsey. He took everything Dempsey had and came back. The fact that he was down six times in that first round didn’t worry him in the least. He was up and after Dempsey like a mad bull after every knock down and traded wallops every time Jack wanted to, and, while tired after the first round, he had given Dempsey plenty to take care of. Dempsey, probably realizing that Luis was lacking experience but at the same time realizing that he had a huge man to deal with, decided on his rushing style to take Firpo.
