## BOTH BOYS HAVE MANY BACKERS IN BIG RING BATTLE TOMORROW

NEW YORK, July 26.—An axiom of boxing promoters is "always build up the contender."

That is what they are doing for Lew Tendler. A month ago, around New York, Leonard was considered a sure winner in tomorrow’s fight, but the "bull" reports coming from Tendler’s training camp have raised a doubt. George B. Rickard, the promoter, expects to cash in heavily on this doubt.

Leonard, speaking more frankly to newspaper men than he ever did on the eve of an important championship battle, makes light of Tendler’s chances to go twelve rounds with him.

"I hope you boys continue to boost Tendler’s stock," he said at his Budd Lake camp, "for that will make the gate a big one. However, I want to say right here that I consider this one of the softest bouts I ever signed for. I can't see Tendler at all. He can't box with me, and I can hit with him. Those stories about him developing a crushing left hand make me laugh. I've fought those hard sockers before. He could open up with Bobby Barrett, who is a ring novice, and Johnny Dundee, who is a notoriously light hitter. Just let him come at me wide open and watch what happens."

Leonard is not given to idle boasting, hence his remarks on Tendler must be taken as an indication of perfect confidence in his own powers.

"One reason I am so sure Tendler will not stay the limit with me," says Benny, "is that I am approaching this fight in the best physical and mental condition I have enjoyed for three years. Training out here in the open has brought wonderful results.

"Tendler's crowd I notice, are figuring on Lew to beat the Leonard who fought Jack Britton a few weeks ago. There is no comparison between my form then and now. Before I met Britton I hadn't had a fight in three months. I trained in a gymnasium and rain kept me off the road. I did everything badly when I got into the ring with Britton.

"That fight and the one with Kansas put me on edge. The few New Yorkers who saw the bout at Michigan City marvelled at my improvement. I have kept on improving. I think you will admit that my boxing and footwork are good against my sparring partners here. No, Tendler will not meet the Leonard that lost to Britton."

Tendler’s actions and words bespeak confidence suppressed. Lefty Lew has not replied publicly to Leonard's scornful estimate of his prowess. Privately, he has expressed bitter resentment.. Lew is not much of a talker on any subject. He maintains, however, that the impending combat is not preying on his mind.

"The best man will win," is what he tells the interviewers who are flocking to his camp at Delanco, N. J.

A majority of the Philadelphia boxing experts, who have been observing Tendler closely this last week, incline to the belief that the fight will go the limit or will end with a claim of foul by Leonard. They base this belief on the probability of Tendier fighting carefully to avoid Leonard's right-hand punches.

"Tendler, according to the form he has shown us," writes Jimmy Gantz, a Quaker City expert, "and the lack of condition Leonard has been inclined to exhibit, should beat the champion on points. A knockout is not expected, but if there is one, we expect Tendler to score it. Leonard is the champion and cannot lose the title in a decisionless bout no matter how far Lew outpoints him. He will be inclined to box carefully to avoid a knockout, which is Tendler’s one chance to kick Benny out from under his crown."

Gantz goes on to show how easily Tendler could have finished Leonard if he had been in the ring against Benny the night he clashed with Britton. However, nobody thinks Leonard will be that far off his real form tomorrow night.

Charley White, of Chicago. is the first prominent challenger to arrive here from a distant point. White came in yesterday from Chicago. He already has posted $2,500 with the New York State boxing commission as evidence of his sincere desire to engage the winner of the big bout.
