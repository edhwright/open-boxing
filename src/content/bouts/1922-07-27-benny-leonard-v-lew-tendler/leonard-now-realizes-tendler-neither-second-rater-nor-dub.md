## LEONARD NOW REALIZES TENDLER NEITHER SECOND-RATER NOR DUB

### Champion Gets $191,250 as His Share of Gate, While Challenger Tendler Receives $90,000.

NEW YORK, July 28.-Benny Leonard still holds the world’s lightweight boxing championship, but realizes that Lew Tendler, Philadelphia lefthander, is neither a "second rater" nor a "dub."

Champion since 1917, when he bowled over English Freddie Welsh, Leonard walked out of the great pine bowl on Boyle's Thirty Acres last night with the crown perched far back on his head. Tendler put it there. Had the challenger the stamina to hold the lead he gained in the early rounds he would have knocked it off. Leonard won by the palest of shades.

Silent throughout the arduous days of training to the belittling statements that Leonard made about him, Tendler gave his answer last night. It came hard and straight from his left shoulder. Leonard had predicted that he would finish Tendler within seven rounds. In that period Leonard brushed aside blood that trickled from his brow, turned his head to one side, spat out a tooth and grunted dissatisfaction.

Tendler, always a body crusher, employed a style unexpected of him. Perhaps it was strategy. Anyway his attack was diversified, especially after he had been warned repeatedly for striking dangerously near the foul line. Yet Leonard's defense had much to do with this. Tendler found that he could not pump both hands indiscriminately into the champion's torso. Leonard's big failure was in his legs. Not until near the finish did he prance about, striking and darting away.

After Tex Rickard announced today that the receipts from the Leonard-Tendler fight were about $450,000, fight fans figuring Leonard's share which was 42 ½ per cent. of the gross estimated that the lightweight champion would get about $191,250, while Tendler would receive about $90,000 on a basis of 30 per cent. Rickard’s expenses for the battle were reckoned at $15,000 aside from the fighters’ shares and his profit was declared to be $153,750.
