## BOTH CONFIDENT OF WINNING BY KNOCKOUT

### Tendler Thinks His Body Attack Will Win Title for Him.

#### By Lew Tendler.

There will be a new lightweight champion of the world before midnight. I feel confident that my body attack will stop Leonard. I don’t think he can take it in the midsection, and that’s the spot that I'm going to be after from the start, and it won't take me long to have the champion so that he will be in a position to succumb to a good punch on the jaw if the body bombardment doesn’t do the trick.

Don't think that I am cocky about this fight-that I am all swelled up with my own importance. I have been watching Leonard in action for some months and I feel sure that I can whip him.

Benny has been telling every one that I am a dub-well, a dub is going to beat him to-night.

I was never in such fine condition for a bout as I am for this one. This is the opportunity for which I have long awaited. It means a million dollars to me to win the title, and if trying my best will earn the championship for me I'm already returned a winner.

### Leonard Says That He Will Win the Bout Inside of Seven Rounds.

#### By Benny Leonard

I will win inside of seven rounds.

When I enter the ring to-night I will face Tendler in the greatest shape of my career. And in the condition I am right now I do not think Tendler is the man to relieve me of my title.

Candidly, I have not much respect for my opponent's defense. I do not think it sufficently strong to withstand my punching ability. I am punching harder than ever right now, and my wind and speed could not be improved upon.

No matter what form of battle Tendler may depend on, I am confident I am prepared for him. He can make it a rushing battle or fight defensively, his style is immaterial to me. He will find that I am primed to meet him at any style he may choose.

Every blow that I land will be driven home with my full power, and I do not anticipate much trouble in landing. I will enter the ring with just one object—a knockout of Tendler as quickly as possible. I may finish him in the very first round-at least I am positive I will be able to stop Tendler inside of seven rounds.
